By convention, every blog needs an initial post where the author overpromises what is to come, so here it goes...

In academic research, there are not many great outlets for sharing the little things we learn along the way to more formal reports or publications. For example, I have been doing a lot of programming recently and discovering lots of cool little things that I'd like to share with the world. From now on, I resolve to drop those things and any other interesting tidbits into blog posts here.

Wish me luck.

From the top of my head, some things I might write about:
- the upcoming [Geohackweek](http://geohackweek.github.io/) that I will be participating in
- building a shareable data dashboard with Python
- summary results of the 2018 LEIA Project field season
- turning Python code into a distributable Python package
