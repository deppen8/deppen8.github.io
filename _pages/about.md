I am a PhD candidate in archaeology within the [Department of Anthropology](https://anthropology.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu/) in Seattle, USA.

For my PhD project, I am building a set of software tools, SurveySim, that will simulate archaeological field surveys. These tools will assist in all stages of a survey project. In the planning stages, they can show how different field methodologies might change the expectations about the possible results of a survey. The tools can also be used to demonstrate compliance with heritage regulations regarding field methods.

SurveySim will also be useful after a survey has taken place. It can accept inputs of existing data like transect and find locations and "re-run" the survey with a variety of different parameters. For example, the user could vary the surface visibility or the surveyor skill to see how those parameters might have impacted the observed results.

The software will also provide tools to summarize and visualize the results of a simulation and comparisons between different runs.

This research is being informed by experience conducting survey as part of the [Landscape, Encounters, and Identity Archaeology Project](https://leiap.weebly.com/).

# Research interests

My work in Mallorca has also allowed me to study ceramic consumption during the Talaiotic and Post-talaiotic periods (Iron Age) in Mallorca.

Prior to joining the LEIA Project in Mallorca, my research focused on the complex dynamics of climate change, animal communities, and human behavior at sites related to the Fort Ancient culture in southwest Ohio.

I am also a member of the [Digital Archaeology Research (DigAR) Lab](https://www.digarlab.uw.edu/). As a part of the DigAR Lab, I am interested in advancing the use of digital technologies and information in archaeology. This includes things like writing code to speed up or automate data analysis, creating novel data visualizations, designing mobile apps, and exploring ways that digital technologies can help archaeologists ask new questions, develop new methods, and generally do better research.

My interests also extend to zooarchaeology, archaeological information science, spatial analysis, and issues of archaeological practice.
