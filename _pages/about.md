I am a PhD candidate in archaeology within the [Department of Anthropology](https://anthropology.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu/) in Seattle, USA.

My PhD research is a study of Iron Age ceramics from the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca. The Iron Age is often seen as a transitional period in Mallorcan history, from relative isolation to integration with the broader Mediterranean world. One of the consequences of this transition seems to have been increasing trade and consumption of ‘foreign’ goods, especially Punic goods from Ibiza. I am studying the contexts of indigenous consumption of these goods in order to understand if and how indigenous Mallorcans did and/or did not integrate these ‘outside’ goods into their way of life. This research is being conducted as part of the larger [Landscape, Encounters, and Identity Archaeology Project](https://leiap.weebly.com/).

# Research interests
My current work is centered on contextual analyses of ceramic consumption during the Talaiotic and Post-talaiotic periods (Iron Age) in Mallorca.

Prior to joining the LEIA Project in Mallorca, my research focused on the complex dynamics of climate change, animal communities, and human behavior at sites related to the Fort Ancient culture in southwest Ohio.

I am also a member of the [Digital Archaeology Research (DigAR) Lab](https://www.digarlab.uw.edu/). As a part of the DigAR Lab, I am interested in advancing the use of digital technologies and information in archaeology. This includes things like writing code to speed up or automate data analysis, creating novel data visualizations, designing mobile apps, and exploring ways that digital technologies can help archaeologists ask new questions, develop new methods, and generally do better research.

My interests also extend to zooarchaeology, archaeological information science, spatial analysis, and issues of archaeological practice.
