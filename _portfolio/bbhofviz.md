[BBHOFviz](https://deppen8.github.io/bbhof_viz/) is a project using the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) Python package to make linked interactive visualizations of the voting process for the Baseball Hall of Fame based on data collected by Ryan Thibodaux ([@NotMrTibbs](https://twitter.com/NotMrTibbs)) and his team.

Thibodaux and co. have done the amazing work of compiling publicly available ballots for the Baseball Hall of Fame. You can (and should) see the full dataset at [bit.ly/hall19](bit.ly/hall19).

*Static view BBHOFviz from January 4, 2019. Visit the [project page](https://deppen8.github.io/bbhof_viz/) to see interactive version.*

As a fan of that project for a few years now, I thought I might be able to contribute by adding a couple of visualizations that I think help supplement their awesome dataset.
