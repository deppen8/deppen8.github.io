# Data scientist + Archaeologist

I am a full-time data scientist in industry. I have worked across a range of different data science domains: user analytics, forecasting, NLP, and more. Within the data science world, I enjoy building tools, dataviz, and solving tricky problems.

I am also a PhD candidate in archaeology within the [Department of Anthropology](https://anthropology.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu/) in Seattle, USA. For my PhD project, I created [`prospect`](/research/prospect/), a framework for building Monte Carlo simulations of archaeological field surveys with Python. This research is being informed by experience conducting survey research as part of the [Landscape, Encounters, and Identity Archaeology Project](https://leiap.weebly.com/).

Outside of my industry and academic work, I greatly enjoy teaching and contributing to the open source community. I maintain an open source linter tool called [`pandas-vet`](https://github.com/deppen8/pandas-vet), teach workshops with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), and help organize the [SciPy Conference Sprints](https://www.scipy2021.scipy.org/sprints), among other activities.
