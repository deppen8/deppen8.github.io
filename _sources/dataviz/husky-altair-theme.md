# Husky Altair theme

This project defines `husky_theme`, a theme for Altair charts based on the [University of Washington branding guidelines](http://www.washington.edu/brand/graphic-elements/). That said, it is NOT an official product of the University of Washington. Check it out some examples on Binder without downloading or installing anything.

The theme was built with inspiration from Sergio SÃ¡nchez's excellent blog post: [Consistently Beautiful Visualizations with Altair Themes](https://towardsdatascience.com/consistently-beautiful-visualizations-with-altair-themes-c7f9f889602).

## Examples

Below are a few examples using the `husky_theme` to reproduce examples from the [Altair Example Gallery](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html).

The `husky_theme.ipynb` notebook contains a more complete series of examples. In a few cases, I have slightly altered the code from the Altair docs. These are noted along with the example. You can play around with the examples yourself by launching the notebook in Binder.
