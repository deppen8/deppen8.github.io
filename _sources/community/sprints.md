# Sprints

My first real introduction to open source software came at the 2019 PyCascades Sprints. It was there that I met some excellent people and began development of [`pandas-vet`](../open-source/pandas-vet). I brought the project back to PyCascades 2020 Sprints and continued to use it as a way to introduce new people to open source software.

I documented the experience of creating at sprint events in my talk at PyGotham 2019 - [Sprints - Let's Do More of Those!](https://pyvideo.org/pygotham-2019/sprints-lets-do-more-of-those.html) [![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Watch-blue?style=social&logo=youtube)](https://youtu.be/8Wc5MkUdp-4)

In my PyGotham talk, I promised that if there was a sprint event where I could help, I would do everything I could to make it happen. When I saw a note that the SciPy Sprints organizers were looking for help, I was happy to join the team as a co-chair for the [SciPy Conference 2021 Sprints](https://www.scipy2021.scipy.org/sprints).
