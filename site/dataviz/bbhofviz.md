[BBHOFviz](https://deppen8.github.io/bbhof_viz/) is a project using the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) Python package to make linked interactive visualizations of the voting process for the Baseball Hall of Fame based on data collected by Ryan Thibodaux ([@NotMrTibbs](https://twitter.com/NotMrTibbs)) and his team.

Thibodaux and co. have done the amazing work of compiling publicly available ballots for the Baseball Hall of Fame. You can (and should) see the full dataset at [bit.ly/hall19](https://bit.ly/hall19).
