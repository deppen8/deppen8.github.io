# The Carpentries

In early 2018, I attended a [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) workshop series at the University of Washington and got my first introductions to the Unix shell and `git`. I thoroughly enjoyed the Carpentries style of teaching and wanted to pay it forward, so I became a Certified Carpentries Instructor in early 2019.

Since then, I have taught a number of official Carpentries workshops as well as used the Carpentries lessons in non-Carpentries teaching settings.

In 2021, I became an official maintainer of the Carpentries [Unix shell lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice).
