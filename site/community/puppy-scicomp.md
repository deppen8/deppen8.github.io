# PuPPy Scientific Computing

In 2019, I joined some fellow Pythonistas as a co-organizer of the [Puget Sound Python (PuPPy)](https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython) Scientific Computing Special Interest Group. Pre-COVID, we organized monthly in-person talk nights where folks could showcase how they were using Python in scientific research. More than that, however, it was a chance to meet like-minded Pythonistas and become a part of the strong Puget Sound Python community.
