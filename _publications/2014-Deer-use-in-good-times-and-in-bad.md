This project explored the complex relationships between climate change, white-tailed deer populations, and human behavior in prehistoric southwest Ohio. The project began as a senior honors thesis at The Ohio State University under the supervision of Dr. Robert A. Cook and was ultimately expanded, refined, and published in the journal Environmental Archaeology.
